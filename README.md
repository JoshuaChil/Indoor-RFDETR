# Indoor-RFDETR

Welcome to **Indoor-RFDETR**!  
This repository contains scripts and utilities for building an end-to-end pipeline to train an **RFDETR-Nano** model on **annotated indoor object datasets**.

The provided scripts were used to:
- Download annotated indoor object data
- Convert annotations into **COCO format**
- Train and evaluate an **RFDETR-Nano** object detection model

**NOTE**: Currently doesn't have automatically to balance classes, which could result in poorer training results. Updates **ideally* coming soon!

Thanks for stopping by!
